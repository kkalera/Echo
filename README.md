## Project Echo

Project echo is a Unity 3D project to asses the viability of automating ship to shore cranes with AI.

&nbsp;

## Goals

Develop an accurate simulation of a quay crane to test different deep learning approaches in order to develop a model that can be tested on a scaled down version of a ship to shore crane.

&nbsp;

## Achievements

Currently, there have been multiple tests performed using reinforcement learning with the following results:

## Issues

- Currently struggling to find a package that does realistic cable simulations.
- Because of this search, some models and environments are currently broken.
