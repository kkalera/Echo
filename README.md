## Project Echo

Project echo is a Unity 3D project to asses the viability of automating Quay cranes with AI.

The goal is to build a quay crane simulator which can then be programmed to execute crane operations perfectly. This can then be used to gather data to train a model to operate the cranes.

Currently struggling to find a package that does realistic cable simulations.
