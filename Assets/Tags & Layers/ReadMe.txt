In order to make your fields turn into a dropdown for tags or layers,
add a "TagDropdown" or "LayerDropdown" attribute on a field with int 
or string data type.

Feel free to check "TagsAndLayers_Example.cs" script for an example.

The asset contains a demo, which is located in the "Demo" folder.
Feel free to delete the folder if you don't need it.
The asset should be fully functional without it.
